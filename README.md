BrainiFi is a study tool designed for Nigerian university students that helps them learn and prepare for exams more effectively. It processes various types of study materials - from handwritten notes to PDFs and even YouTube lectures.
Here's what it does:

When you scan your handwritten notes or upload PDFs, it processes them and creates study materials like flashcards and practice questions
It acts like a personal tutor - you can ask it to explain concepts and it walks you through them step by step
For YouTube educational content, you can use our BrainiFi prefix (like "bf.youtube.com/...") and it automatically transcribes the video, summarizes key points, and creates study notes
It has an "Exam Mode" that uses Nigerian university examination patterns to generate practice questions similar to what you'd face in actual exams
The system learns from your study patterns - if you're struggling with certain topics, it automatically focuses more questions and explanations on those areas

The tool adapts to how you learn, tracks your progress, and includes features like timed study sessions using the Pomodoro technique to help you study more efficiently.
What sets it apart is its focus on Nigerian university education and its ability to turn any study material - whether it's your messy class notes, lecturer's PDFs, or educational videos - into organized, useful study content.
